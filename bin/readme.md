# RÃ˜DECasterFileSplit - BIN folder

This folder shall include the FFMPEG executable files for Windows. I will not include them here!!!

Get them at [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org) and put them here:
* `ffmpeg.exe` (mandatory)
* `ffprobe.exe` (not necessary, but useful)

Thanks and enjoy!

## Alternative:
Install ffmpeg globally in your Windows system... I don't know, if there is an installer for that and I don't care. :)

Remember to remove the `.\bin\` line in the `.bat` files if you do so!
